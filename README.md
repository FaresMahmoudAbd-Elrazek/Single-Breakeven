## Configuration ⚙️

The Single Breakeven advisor comes with several configurable options:

- **Breakeven Level**: Set the price level where the breakeven will be triggered.
- **Stop-Loss**: Define your stop-loss distance from the breakeven point.
- **Take-Profit**: Set your take-profit target.
- **Trade Symbol**: Specify the currency pair you want to trade.

### Example Configuration:

```mql
input double BreakevenLevel = 1.2000; // Set your breakeven level
input double StopLoss = 50;            // Set stop-loss in pips
input double TakeProfit = 100;         // Set take-profit in pips
```

## How It Works 🔍

The Single Breakeven expert advisor monitors all open trades for the selected symbol. Once the price reaches the defined breakeven level, it adjusts the stop-loss to the breakeven point. This helps to secure your profits and minimize losses.

1. **Monitoring Trades**: The advisor continuously checks the status of open trades.
2. **Triggering Breakeven**: When the price hits the breakeven level, it adjusts the stop-loss.
3. **Managing Risks**: By setting stop-loss and take-profit levels, the advisor helps you manage your trading risks effectively.
